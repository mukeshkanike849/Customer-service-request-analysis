# DESCRIPTION

## Background of Problem Statement :

NYC 311's mission is to provide the public with quick and easy access to all New York City government services and information while offering the best customer service. Each day, NYC311 receives thousands of requests related to several hundred types of non-emergency services, including noise complaints, plumbing issues, and illegally parked cars.

## Analysis Tasks performed:

### Performing a service request data analysis of New York City 311 calls:

1. Imported a 311 NYC service request.
2. Read or converted the columns ‘Created Date’ and Closed Date’ to datetime datatype and created a new column ‘Request_Closing_Time’ as the time elapsed between request     creation and request closing.
3. Provided major insights/patterns in a visual format (graphs or tables).
4. Ordered the complaint types based on the average ‘Request_Closing_Time’, grouping them for different locations.
5. Performed a statistical test for the following:
    * Whether the average response time across complaint types is similar or not (overall).
    * Are the type of complaint or service requested and location related?
